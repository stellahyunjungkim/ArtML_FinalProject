# ArtML_FinalProject

“Art is a language, an instrument of knowledge, an instrument of communication” (Jean Dubuffet).  Our team also  believes the converse to be true; language is a form of art.  However, this luxury of communication is not always accessible to everyone.
Consequently, our team was interested in the possibility of utilizing machine learning to primarily assist in real-time American Sign Language recognition. Our secondary goal was to create a device (using primarily Arduino) that would allow a person who utilizes ASL to communicate with a blind person.
